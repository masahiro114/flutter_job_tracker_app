## Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

### MVVM Breakdown:

1. **Model**: This layer is responsible for the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with external resources, such as APIs or databases, to retrieve or manipulate data.
    - Located in: `lib/models/` and `lib/services/`
    - **Example**: `user.dart`, `application.dart`, `auth_service.dart`, `application_service.dart`

2. **View**: The **View** layer represents the UI and displays the data that is passed from the **ViewModel**. It is mostly passive and doesn't handle business logic.
    - Located in: `lib/views/`
    - **Example**: `sign_up.dart`, `home.dart`, `applications_list.dart`

3. **ViewModel**: The **ViewModel** is responsible for managing the application's state, handling business logic, and preparing data for the **View** to display. It communicates with the **Model** layer to fetch and process data.
    - Located in: `lib/view_models/`
    - **Example**: `auth_view_model.dart`, `application_view_model.dart`
